## Decision Making Process

### Consensus Seeking

The project aims to make decisions through a consensus-seeking process. This involves:

1. **Proposal**: Any contributor can make a proposal for a change.
2. **Discussion**: The proposal is discussed by the community. Feedback is provided, and adjustments are made as necessary.
3. **Consensus**: If there are no significant objections, the proposal is considered to have reached consensus and can be implemented.

### Voting

If consensus cannot be reached, a vote may be called. Voting rules are as follows:

- **Eligibility**: Only maintainers are eligible to vote.
- **Majority Rule**: A simple majority is required for a proposal to pass.
- **Final Decision**: In case of a tie, the lead maintainer has the final decision.

- **Frequency**: Bi-weekly

## Code of Conduct
